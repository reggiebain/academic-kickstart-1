# Biography

I am an Instructional Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Houston. This fall, I am teaching PHYS 1301 at UH, including an Inquiry-based section at UH's Active Learning Center @ Cougar Place. My current research interests include various projects in physics education and science communication, as well as theoretical nuclear/particle physics. My background is in QCD phenomenology and the applications of Effective Field Theories to problems in hadronic physics.

I am active in a number of teaching, science communication, and outreach efforts including the ComSciCon national and local workshop series. I have been generously supported by many organizations including the University of Houston, the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the Duke Townes-Perkin-Elmer Fellowship, the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, and the Olin D. Johnston Carolina Scholarship at the University of South Carolina-Honors College.
