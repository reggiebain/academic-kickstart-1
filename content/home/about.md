# Biography

I am a theoretical nuclear/particle physicist with a deep interest in physics education research (PER). I am currently Instructional Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Houston. This fall, I am teaching PHYS 1301, including an studio/inquiry-style section in UH's Active Learning Classroom @ Cougar Place.

My research background is in QCD and the applications of Effective Field Theories to the production of bound states of heavy quark/anti-quark pairs called quarkonia. At UH, I work on building targeted resources for students in introductory courses including developing innovative multimedia resources for my studio-style courses. I am active in a number of teaching, science communication, and outreach efforts both within and outside of UH. These include being a Physics Teacher Education Coalition fellow for 2018/2019, organizing ComSciCon national and local science communication workshops for graduate students, and coordinating the UH Physics Learning Center.

I have been generously supported by many organizations including the University of Houston, the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the Duke Townes-Perkin-Elmer Fellowship, the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, and the Olin D. Johnston Carolina Scholarship at the University of South Carolina-Honors College.
